#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

# List of inputs to fetch data.
filebeat.inputs:
# Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

# Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
# The different types cannot be mixed in one input
#
# Possible options are:
# * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
# * stdin: Reads the standard in

#------------------------------ Log input --------------------------------
# - type: log

#   # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
#   enabled: true

#   # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
#   # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
#   # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
#   # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
#   # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
#   paths:
#     - /usr/share/filebeat/nginx/access.log


#==================== Elasticsearch template setting ==========================

setup.template.settings:
  index.number_of_shards: 3
  #index.codec: best_compression
  #_source.enabled: false


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
setup.dashboards.enabled: false
setup.dashboards.index: mds-nginx-*
setup.template.overwrite: true
setup.template.name: "mds-nginx"
setup.template.pattern: "mds-nginx-*"


# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:


#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using filebeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
cloud.auth: elastic:GLeC2zL55ENkYaV2cY0rtomt

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# output.console:
#   pretty: true

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
