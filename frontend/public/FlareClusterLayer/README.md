This is a stripped down version of [FCL library](https://github.com/nickcam/FlareClusterLayer)

The application is hosting its own version as the library isn't hosted on a central server or as an NPM module.
This way the library version and code remains static.
It also enables us to tweak the library source code to fit our needs.
