            MineSpace is a pilot project as a part of the MDS digital product. MineSpace will be the portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry. In time, mines will be able to submit documentation to the ministry, as well as check the status of reporting requirements, and documentation that they have submitted to the ministry for review. The pilot project will run in the spring of 2019 with full integration in early 2020.

              The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin ahead of time.

                The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin ahead of time.

                    In order to submit information through MineSpace, you will need to register for a Business BCeID. This process can take several weeks, so ensure you allow plenty of time before end of year reporting deadlines.

              MineSpace is a pilot project as a part of the MDS digital product. MineSpace will be the portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry. In time, mines will be able to submit documentation to the ministry, as well as check the status of reporting requirements, and documentation that they have submitted to the ministry for review. The pilot project will run in the spring of 2019 with full integration in early 2020.

                The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin ahead of time.

                  The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin ahead of time.

                    The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin ahead of time.
