            The Mines Digital Service (MDS) is a digital product being iteratively developed and designed to hold mine-related data that is user-friendly, trustworthy and reliable.

            MineSpace is a piece of the Mines Digital Services Product that provides a link between the mine proponent and the Ministry. It is the online portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry by submitting reports and information as required by the Health, Safety, and Reclamation Code. MineSpace will enable mines to check the status of their reporting requirements and see the documentation that they have submitted to the Ministry for review. The portal is live and is expanding throughout 2019.

              2019 pilot project
            </h1>
            <p>
              In March 2019, 6 mines were asked to participate in a pilot project to demonstrate how document submission would work in MineSpace. The pilot focused on the 2018 TSF annual reporting period and asked mines to submit required TSF reports through the MineSpace portal. During the pilot, an additional 26 mines were recruited by word of mouth and chose to participate. Following the pilot project, feedback from the participating mines showed that document submission through MineSpace was a success. It resulted in a total of 32 mines voluntarily logging into MineSpace and submitting 120 required TSF reports. The submitted TSF reports were then instantly made available for Ministry staff to review - making it easier for both mines and Ministry staff to track document submission status.

            </h1>
            <p>
              The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin as soon as possible.

                  In order to submit information through MineSpace, you will need to register for a Business BCeID. This process can take several weeks, so ensure you allow plenty of time before end of year reporting deadlines.

                    In order to submit information through MineSpace, you will need to register for a Business BCeID. This process can take several weeks, so ensure you allow plenty of time before end of year reporting deadlines.

                  In March 2019, 6 mines were asked to participate in a pilot project to demonstrate how document submission would work in MineSpace. The pilot focused on the 2018 TSF annual reporting period and asked mines to submit required TSF reports through the MineSpace portal. During the pilot, an additional 26 mines were recruited by word of mouth and chose to participate. Following the pilot project, feedback from the participating mines showed that document submission through MineSpace was a success. It resulted in a total of 32 mines voluntarily logging into MineSpace and submitting 120 required TSF reports. The submitted TSF reports were then instantly made available for Ministry staff to review - making it easier for both mines and Ministry staff to track document submission status.

                <p>
                  The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin as soon as possible.

              MineSpace is a piece of the Mines Digital Services Product that provides a link between the mine proponent and the Ministry. It is the online portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry by submitting reports and information as required by the Health, Safety, and Reclamation Code. MineSpace will enable mines to check the status of their reporting requirements and see the documentation that they have submitted to the Ministry for review. The portal is live and is expanding throughout 2019.

                2019 pilot project
              </h1>
              <p>
                In March 2019, 6 mines were asked to participate in a pilot project to demonstrate how document submission would work in MineSpace. The pilot focused on the 2018 TSF annual reporting period and asked mines to submit required TSF reports through the MineSpace portal. During the pilot, an additional 26 mines were recruited by word of mouth and chose to participate. Following the pilot project, feedback from the participating mines showed that document submission through MineSpace was a success. It resulted in a total of 32 mines voluntarily logging into MineSpace and submitting 120 required TSF reports. The submitted TSF reports were then instantly made available for Ministry staff to review - making it easier for both mines and Ministry staff to track document submission status.

              </h1>
              <p>
                The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin as soon as possible.

It is the online portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry by submitting reports and information as required by the Health, Safety, and Reclamation Code. MineSpace will enable mines to check the status of their reporting requirements and see the documentation that they have submitted to the Ministry for review. The portal is live and is expanding throughout 2019.

                <p>
                  In March 2019, 6 mines were asked to participate in a pilot project to demonstrate how document submission would work in MineSpace. The pilot focused on the 2018 TSF annual reporting period and asked mines to submit required TSF reports through the MineSpace portal. During the pilot, an additional 26 mines were recruited by word of mouth and chose to participate. Following the pilot project, feedback from the participating mines showed that document submission through MineSpace was a success. It resulted in a total of 32 mines voluntarily logging into MineSpace and submitting 120 required TSF reports. The submitted TSF reports were then instantly made available for Ministry staff to review - making it easier for both mines and Ministry staff to track document submission status.

                <p>
                  The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and it is best to begin as soon as possible.

                      In order to submit information through MineSpace, you will need to register for a Business BCeID. This process can take several weeks, so ensure you allow plenty of time before end of year reporting deadlines.
