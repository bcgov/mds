          The Mines Digital Service (MDS) is a digital product being iteratively developed and
          designed to hold mine related data that is user-friendly, trustworthy and reliable. The
          product will eventually replace the existing internal Mine Management System used by the
          Ministry and be used to surface information to the{" "}

            BC Mine Information website
          </a>
          . The MDS project was started in July to help inspectors manage the mines they work with
          by replacing existing legacy systems and adding new functionality.

          MineSpace is a pilot project as a part of the MDS digital product. MineSpace will be the
          portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry. In time, Mines will be able to
          submit documentation to the Ministry, as well as check the status of reporting
          requirements, and documentation that they have submitted to the ministry for review. The
          pilot project will run in the spring of 2019 with full integration in early 2020.

          The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online
          portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace
          starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and
          compliance information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and
          verify your existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can
          take time and it is best to begin ahead of time.

              In order to submit information through MineSpace, you will need to register for a
              Business BCeID. This process can take several weeks, so ensure you allow plenty of
              time before end of year reporting deadlines.
