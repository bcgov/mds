        The Mines Digital Service (MDS) is a digital product being iteratively developed and
        designed to hold mine related data that is user-friendly, trustworthy and reliable. The
        product will eventually replace the existing internal Mine Management System used by the
        Ministry and be used to surface information to the{" "}
        <a href="http://mines.nrs.gov.bc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          BC Mine Information website
        </a>
        . The MDS project was started in July to help inspectors manage the mines they work with by
        replacing existing legacy systems and adding new functionality.

      <br />
      <p>
        MineSpace is a pilot project as a part of the MDS digital product. MineSpace will be the
        portal through which mines can interact with the Ministry. In time, Mines will be able to
        submit documentation to the Ministry, as well as check the status of reporting requirements,
        and documentation that they have submitted to the ministry for review. The pilot project
        will run in the spring of 2019 with full integration in early 2020.

        The pilot represents an initial step in mines interacting with Ministry through an online
        portal. We will require all mines to submit their required reporting through MineSpace
        starting in 2020, including variance requests, dangerous occurrence reports, and compliance
        information. To use this system you will need to get a business BCeID, and verify your
        existing credentials if you have not already already done so. This process can take time and
        it is best to begin ahead of time.
