// ITCSS file structure, layers include: (Settings, Tools, Generic, Elements, Objects, Components, Utilities)
// most styling will be found in the Components and Objects folder.

// SETTINGS - Used with pre-processors. Global settings that contain font, colors definitions, etc.
// TOOLS - globally used mixins and functions. (ie gradient mixins, font-sizing mixins)
@import "./tools/mixins.scss";
// GENERIC - Very high level, far-reaching styles. Contains Normalize.css, Box-sizing rules, CSS resets etc.
@import "./generic/Normalize.scss";
// ELEMENTS - Bare, un-classed HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). This layer is rarely touched after initial setup.
// OBJECTS - layouts (CSS Grid or flexbox)

// COMPONENTS - specific UI components.

// UTILITIES - utilities and helper classes. This layer has the highest specificity.
