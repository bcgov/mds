# Functional Test Automation

This project automates a selection of functional tests on multiple browsers using Geb integrated with Spock and Gradle. It helps to efficiently check if the addition of new features or bug fixes has broke any previously developed features. The test strategy for this project is discussed on the mds confluence page:
https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=39651197
(accessing this page will require IDIR login)

## Tools

- [Geb](http://www.gebish.org/manual/current/)

A Selenium WebDriver wrapper which integrates well with Groovy and Spock syntax and provides flexibility working with multiple browsers and simplicity on writing tests.

- [Spock](http://spockframework.org/)

A testing framework whose Arrange-Act-Assert structure best matches the BDD's(Behaviour Driven Development) Given-When-Then scenario description format.

- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

A build tool to build the groovy project and manage its dependencies.

## Folder Structure

- `build.gradle` : Build configuration for Gradle
- `gradle.properties` : Environment properties used in the Gradle build
- `gradlew(.bat)` : Gradle runner executable
- `src/test/groovy/resources` : Configuration for Geb
- `src/test/groovy/<Project Name>/spec` : Specification for test cases/scenarios
- `src/test/groovy/data` : SQL to create/delete test data directly from the DB
- `src/test/groovy/<Project Name>/modules` and `src/test/<Project Name>/pages` : Definition of modules/pages in the app
- `src/test/groovy/utils` : Constants being used in the test script

## Environment Setup

Follow the `.env-example` template to create an `.env` file under `/functional-tests` with valid IDIR credentials and database connection information before running the test.

## Run tests with Gradle

The following commands will launch the tests with the individual browsers.
They must be run in the functional test (current) directory.
The minespace-frontend tests are run by replacing CustomJUnitSpecRunner with CustomJUnitPublicSpecRunner

The core frontend tests here will be run with the following commands
./gradlew chromeTest -DchromeTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner
./gradlew chromeHeadlessTest -DchromeHeadlessTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner //download tsf test will fail due to chrome-headless bug
./gradlew firefoxTest -DfirefoxTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner
./gradlew firefoxHeadlessTest -DfirefoxHeadlessTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner

- Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` in the above examples if you're on Windows.

Only on windows:

    gradlew.bat edgeTest -DedgeTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner
    gradlew.bat ieTest -DieTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner

Only on MacOS:
//TODO: these are currently broken, most likely problem is that the GebConfig.groovy is out of date
./gradlew safariTest -DsafariTest.single=CustomJUnitSpecRunner

## Run tests in project's root

The firefox (non headless) tests can also be run from the projects root using the command 'make test'

## Modifying tests that run in the pipeline

The shell script controlling how the tests in the pipeline are run is run_test.sh. If new test suits need to be added to the
GEB testing process this is where they will be added.

## Test Report

Report can be found under `/functional-tests/build/reports/tests`

## Common Problems

- Data clean up FAILS:

This often occurs when a new table is added to the database and the clean up script attempts to delete a linked table. Often
running the test on a clean database will work. Though sometimes the data_deletion.sql script will have to be modified to
delete dependancies before proceeding.

- The login test fails locally:

If you've never managed to run the functional tests locally before, make certain your .env file matches the .env example.
You will need to get the password from openshift secrets.

- Data clean up fails with an error like `org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: role "mds" does not exist`:

You may be running postgres locally for a different project. Make certain to stop that process, then run `make database`
in the project root.
