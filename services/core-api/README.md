# Backend API


The project uses a Python 3.6 runtime environment and [Flask
REST-plus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework for the
API.

The application uses SQLAlchemy as our ORM to interact with the database.

For the application directory structure, see [flask-RESTplus quickstart
guide.](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)

## Directory/Naming convention

The application directory is structured as follows:

```
|-- app
    |-- api
        |-- NAMESPACE_MODULE_NAME
            |-- Namespace (Contains api namespace)
            |-- MODULE_NAME
                |-- Models (Contains all the database model definition used by SQLAlchemy)
                |-- Resources (Contains all the routes and views to handle incoming requests)
    |-- utils (Contains utility shared across modules)
|-- tests (Unit/Integration tests for the application)
|-- app.sh (Shell script used by the python OpenShift s2i image to run the application)
|-- Dockerfile (Dockerfile for running the application locally using Docker)
|-- requirements.txt (Libraries required by the project)
```

## Pre-requisites and Installation

If running on your host machine, the application assumes you already have a
working postgres DB with the required schema and tables and have the connection
details in the .env file.

Follow the `.env-example` template to create an `.env` file with valid values
before running the application.

A. OS Level Installation
 - [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
 - [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
 - [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

1. Create a virtual environment with python 3.6 and activate it
```
virtualenv -p python3.6 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: For Ubuntu/Debian based systems, you may have to install libpq-dev. You can do this via:

sudo apt install libpq-dev

3. Run the application
```
flask run
```

B. Using a docker container
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

1. Switch current directory to the project root
```
cd ../
```

2. Issue the makefile command that runs the backend
```
make backend
```

## Flask Click commands

Flask supports [click commands](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/cli/) which
lets you run one-off commands from the command line without having to run the
complete app.

To see the list of all click commands, checkout `register_commands` method
under the `__init__.py` file.

## Document Generator Service

The MDS document generator service makes use of the Common Services team's [Document Generator Service](https://github.com/bcgov/common-services-team-library/tree/master/images/doc-gen-api/app).

### Click commands workflow to transfer files to the object store 
*Pre-requisite to running the transfer-files, verify-files, and reorganize-files commands: ensure that a Celery worker is running. You can use the command `ps aux` to check.

**I want to transfer all documents that exist on the filesystem to the object store**
 1. Get a list of untransferred files:<br/>
    `flask untransferred-files`
 2. Transfer those files to the object store:<br/>
    `flask transfer-files`<br/>
    You can view the output of the task in the celery logfile.
 3. Check the result of the transfer in the logfile or in the result backend. Act accordingly depending on the status of the job.
 4. Get a list of untransferred files:<br/>
    `flask untransferred-files`<br/>
    If the previous transfer task was successful, this list should be empty. If it contains documents, you should see the reason why in the job results.
 5. Double-check that the transfer task was successful and that all locally-stored files match their corresponding files on the object store:<br/>
    `flask verify-files`<br/>
    If you want, log into Cyberduck or another tool to view the files that were transferred to the object store.<br/>
    
See [here](https://github.com/bcgov/mds/pull/1380/) for a more detailed instructional workflow.

## Testing

The application uses `pytest` to run the tests and `coverage` to output the
results. The testing structure is based around [flask testing
documentation.](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/testing/)

To run tests, use the following command:
```
coverage run --branch --source=app -m pytest
```
