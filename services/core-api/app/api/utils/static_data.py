""" 
This function is run right before setup_marshmallow and it looks through all of tables in our database.
It creates a mapping of classes to lists if their PK's, this is only done for code tables. To find the code tables
the classes are inspected and if they have a column named active_ind, it's type is not a UUID and its type is a string
the PK's are added to STATIC_DATA under the class name.

Parameters: Base <SQL Alchemy Model>
Return: None
