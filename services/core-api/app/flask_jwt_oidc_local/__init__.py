"""Flask-JWT-OIDC is a JWT, JWKS manager.

Is a highly opinionated extension that supports JWR Bearer tokens issued
by OIDC compliant servers

Minimum config:

 JWT_OIDC_WELL_KNOWN_CONFIG= HTTPS URL to .well_known oidc_config
 JWT_OIDC_AUDIENCE= the OIDC Audience or Client_Id
 JWT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET= the OIDC client_secret

 JWT_ROLE_CALLBACK is a required callback, that must return a list of roles
 ex:
        def get_roles(dict):
            return dict['realm_access']['roles']
            app.config['JWT_ROLE_CALLBACK'] = get_roles


 The jwks_uri & issuer URLs are obtained from the .well_known config endpoint

 Optional Configs:

 JWT_OIDC_ALGORITHMS="RS256"

 JWT_OIDC_JWKS_URI (str): an HTTPS to jwks_uri which is an array of valid RSA keys
 JWT_OIDC_ISSUER (str): an HTTPS URL that is the ISS of the token
 JWT_OIDC_AUDIENCE (str): the oidc client audience (sometimes called client_id)
 JWT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET (str): the client secret assigned to this audience
 JWT_OIDC_AUTH_ERROR_HANDLER: (fn) to handle raised AuthError
