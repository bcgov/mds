### Postgres 13 Database.

This postgres database is built out of a generic Postgres 13 image.

It is used as a common image for the following workloads:

- Fider
- Metabase

The main postgres 13 DB used by core-api is built a little different, including oracle fdw, which is not required for other application databases.
