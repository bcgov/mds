          Mine review committees (MRCs) are a key part of the coordinated authorizations process. An MRC is an advisory committee established by the Chief Permitting Officer (CPO) under Section 9 of the Mines Act. By bringing together multiple ministries, Indigenous nations, federal and local governments, and other reviewers, MRCs increase efficiency and effectiveness by reducing duplication of effort and by focusing on the project as a whole.

            Does your project require a coordinated review by a Mine Review Committee, under Section 9 of the Mines Act?

          This response will be reviewed by the Major Mines Office and confirmed by the Chief Permitting Officer.
