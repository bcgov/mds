                  In order to access MineSpace, you need to register for a Business or Personal BCeID. It can take several weeks to process the request, so give yourself plenty of lead time.

                  Once you have your BCeID, you can add employees and delegates. You can request that anyone added to your Business BCeID account be given access to MineSpace.
