## Prerequisites

To run the service, create an Amazon S3 bucket in one of the AWS Regions for accessing and storing the S3 objects as files or folders. Create an [Amazon S3 account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and then create S3 bucket to perform the file operations. Then, open the `AmazonS3FileProvider` and register your Amazon S3 client account details like awsAccessKeyId, awsSecretAccessKey, bucketRegion, and bucketName details in `RegisterAmazonS3` method to perform the file operations. 

```
  void RegisterAmazonS3(string bucketName, string awsAccessKeyId, string awsSecretAccessKey, string bucketRegion);
```
