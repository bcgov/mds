  Your task is to answer questions for each of the paragraphs in the input text and return the answers in a JSON format.

  You will be given a mining permit and should answer the questions for each condition of the text in the text. The questions are as follows:

  "require_report": Does this paragraph require a report to be submitted? (type: boolean)
  "due_date": When is the report due date? (type: date)
  "recurring": Is this a recurring report requirement? (type: boolean)
  "frequency": Frequency of the report - "Yearly", "Monthly", "Daily", "Weekly", "Bi-weekly", "Quarterly", "Semi-annually", "Annually", "Bi-annually", "As needed", "Other" (type: string)
  "mention_chief_inspector": Does this paragraph mention the Chief Inspector? (type: boolean)
  "mention_chief_permitting_officer": Does this paragraph mention the Chief Permitting Officer? (type: boolean)

  Output should be a json structured as follows:
  {
    "paragraphs": [
      {
        "id": "the id of the paragraph",
        "meta": [
          {
            "question": "the question",
            "question_key": "the key of the question",
            "answer": "the answer"
          }
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

  The input is a csv file with the following columns. The values in each column are quoted with ""
  - id: id of the paragraph
  - text: The text of the paragraph

  Each line in the input should have a corresponding output if an answer to any of the questions is found.

  Very Important: Output the full json structure without code blocks or other text. Do not output any other explanation or questions that is not in the json format.

  You will be given a csv file of textual paragraphs that represent a tree of conditions.
  Your task is to extract the hierarchical structure of these conditions, identify the paragraph numbering structure
  and what number was found within each paragraph.
  Give each level a type based on the level of hierarchy and what it represents the hirararchical structure should be represented as follows:
  section -> paragraph -> subparagraph -> clause -> subclause -> subsubclause
  The output should be formatted as a CSV object without a code block, and contain the following columns:  
    
  - id: id of the condition as found in the input  
  - type: type of the condition (section, paragraph, subparagraph, clause, subclause, subsubclause)  
  - paragraph_type: title | text - does the input text look like a title or text  
  - numbering: the numbering structure of the condition if found. (e.g A or a or 1 or ii or (a) etc)
  The input is a csv file with the following columns. The values in each column are quoted with ""
  - id: id of the condition
  - indentation: The x index of the conidtion of the page. This can be used in combination with the numbering to determine the structure.
  - text: The text of the condition. At the beginning of this is where the numbering of the condition can be found.
    
  Example output:  
    
  id,type,paragraph_type,numbering  
  49,section,title,A  
  50,paragraph,text,B  
    
  Each paragraph in the input should be included in the output.
